## Key Findings
Summary of key findings from the demographic analysis and visualizations:
- In conclusion, our comprehensive analysis of marginal workers in Tamil Nadu has yielded valuable demographic insights. We have observed that the majority of these workers belong to the age group of 15-34, signifying the youth's involvement in marginal employment. Furthermore, our exploration has uncovered variations in different industrial categories, shedding light on the diverse economic landscape these workers navigate. Additionally, our examination of gender-specific trends highlights the importance of tailored interventions to address disparities in marginal employment.

- These findings serve as a solid foundation for well-informed policy decisions and initiatives aimed at improving the socioeconomic conditions of marginal workers. The insights derived from our analysis are actionable and hold the potential to drive positive changes in the lives of these individuals.

- For those interested in replicating our analysis or delving deeper into the dataset, we provide access to our Git repository and the README file, which contains detailed instructions on data replication, calculations, and visualizations.
